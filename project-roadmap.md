# Location Sharing App Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
A hybrid location-sharing solution with:
- Android native app for Android user
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for iOS user
- Self-hosted WebSocket server

## Phase 1: Server Setup (Estimated time: 1-2 hours)
1. Create Railway.app account
   - Sign up at railway.app
   - Install Railway CLI: `npm i -g @railway/cli`
   - Login: `railway login`

2. Deploy WebSocket Server
   - Initialize project: `railway init`
   - Copy server code to project
   - Deploy: `railway up`
   - Note down the deployed URL

## Phase 2: Android App (Estimated time: 2-3 hours)
1. Development Environment Setup
   ```bash
   # Install required tools
   npm install -g react-native-cli
   
   # Create new project
   npx react-native init LocationSharingApp
   cd LocationSharingApp
   ```

2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-maps
   npm install @react-native-community/geolocation
   ```

3. Build Release APK
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```
   - APK will be in: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`

## Phase 3: Web App for iOS (Estimated time: 2-3 hours)
1. Create React Project
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app location-web-app
   cd location-web-app
   ```

2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss
   npm install @googlemaps/react-wrapper
   ```

3. Deploy Web App
   - Push to GitHub
   - Deploy on Vercel/Netlify
   - Setup custom domain (optional)

## Phase 4: Security Implementation (Estimated time: 2-3 hours)
1. Basic Authentication
   - Implement simple user registration
   - Add login system
   - Set up JWT tokens

2. End-to-End Encryption
   - Implement WebCrypto API
   - Setup key exchange
   - Encrypt location data

3. HTTPS Setup
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Setup secure WebSocket (wss://)

## Phase 5: iOS User Setup (Estimated time: 30 minutes)
1. Browser Setup
   - Install recommended browser (Firefox Focus/Brave)
   - Configure privacy settings

2. PWA Installation
   1. Open web app in Safari
   2. Tap Share button
   3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
   4. Configure permissions

## Phase 6: Testing (Estimated time: 1-2 hours)
1. Connection Testing
   - Test WebSocket connection
   - Verify real-time updates

2. Location Accuracy
   - Test background location
   - Verify location precision

3. Battery Impact
   - Monitor battery usage
   - Optimize if needed

## Emergency Backup Plan
1. Alternative Communication
   - Setup Signal/Telegram as backup
   - Share offline meeting points

2. Server Backup
   - Document server migration steps
   - Have backup hosting ready

## Maintenance Tasks
1. Regular Updates
   - Check for security updates
   - Update dependencies

2. Monitoring
   - Setup basic server monitoring
   - Monitor WebSocket connections

## Total Estimated Time: 8-13 hours

## Important Notes
- Keep server credentials secure
- Document all configuration changes
- Test thoroughly before traveling
- Have backup communication methods ready
- Monitor battery impact on both devices
- Keep code backups in private repository

## Resources Needed
1. Accounts Required:
   - Railway.app account
   - GitHub account (optional)
   - Vercel/Netlify account (optional)

2. Development Tools:
   - Node.js
   - React Native CLI
   - Android Studio
   - VSCode or preferred IDE

3. Budget Considerations:
   - Railway free tier (500 hours/month)
   - Domain name (optional)
